# Learn to use pretrained model on Keras

HiÔºÅIn this repository I'd like to share some Keras knowledge to all of you.  
I used to get TensorFlow as my first deep learning platform, however, TensorFlow has many senior APIs which are difficult for newbees to learn, and from version 1.12 to 1.9, so many APIs have been changed, which annoied me a lot. But Keras, I only know for couple monthes, makes me feel easy on all tasks. So embrace Keras right now.  
Btw, any problem you can send to [me](jumtsai@foxmail.com) if I'm avilable.
